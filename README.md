# KivyApp
Code for my first Kivy application

First Kivy app.

Purpose of app is to provide user a quote if they are feeling one of the following: Sad, happy, unloved.

User is able to login the app and sign out.

At the moment I have not put any restrictions on the password or username due to not knowing how to do it.

The reset password does not work. I am still trying to learn how to make that functional.
